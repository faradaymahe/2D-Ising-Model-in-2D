## Introduction
Spontaneous magnetization is a very peculiar property in ferromagnetic material. So, this phenomenon arose curiousity to many physicists in twentieth century. At that time, it did not have a perfect mathematical model to explain properly until Ernst Ising turn. He introduce a model which we now known as “Ising Model”. But, the credit goes to his doctorial advisor Wilhelm Lenz, who gave it as a problem to him.

## Main Work
```
This is the numerical implementation of Ising model in 2D .
```
## Strategies
```
Lattice and Spin Model
```
## Object
```
Ferromagnetic Material
```
## Aim
```
To show, there's a phase transition in 2D and to calculate the curie temperature 
(i.e. Critical Temperature)
```
## Version
```
Python v.3.5
```
## Programming Approach
```
Object Oriented Programming
```
